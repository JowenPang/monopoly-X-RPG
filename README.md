[ 6.12PM 29/12] Ann Joe -- Update Shop.java (wanted for Jowen to test out something)

[11.11AM 30/12] NEIL -- Update Empty.java (for Ann Joe to trial and error)

[2.24pm 30/12] Ann Joe- update Empty.java

[11.18pm 30/12] Jowen - update Board( player array change to static so that Sin can access)
                      - update Sin (now can access to player array ,  no more null pointer exception
                      - added git , if you free can go download git , the feature is very useful in your IDE , like can push and pull to update , no need copy paste
                        but the process a bit complicated , i also dunno how to do it actually haha
                        
                        but most importantly is starting next update , update in master , not main anymore, thank you ~
